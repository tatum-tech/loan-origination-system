      <p style="color: #007aff;"><b>Common Use Cases</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Credit & Insurance Underwriting</b>
        <br>
        Take your underwriting processes beyond traditional credit scores by combining rules-based decisioning with predictive machine learning models that analyze historical data and train models that predict defaults on future credit or insurance applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fraud Detection & Transaction Approval</b>
        <br>
        Evaluate applications and transactions in real-time with predictive models that accurately estimate the probability of fraud, saving you time and money while streamlining customer experiences.  Combine these models with rules-based requirements to easily manage quickly changing compliance and regulatory requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Forecasting Sales & Inventory Requirements</b>
        <br>
        Deploy predictive models that learn from prior sales and inventory data and accurately forecast future values.  This can be done at the SKU, category or department level and works for businesses of all types.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Insurance Claims Management</b>
        <br>
        Incorporate predictive analytics across your claims management process to reduce costly manual effort by producing firm and transparent decisions, such as whether to approve, deny or manually review new insurance claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Equipment Maintenance Predictions</b>
        <br>
        Prevent unnecessary downtime and schedule maintenance in advance with predictive models that forecast failures based on usage rates, hours, locations and other factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Estimating Loan Recoveries</b>
        <br>
        Accurately estimating loan recoveries can be achieved with machine learning models that scan input data and accurately predict recovery rates. Further, use rules management to increase recovery rates by managing NSF, no-pay and other actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Account Opening</b>
        <br>
        Make the right first impression with potential customers by streamlining account opening processes that include complex business logic – all while ensuring compliance with transparent rules management.
